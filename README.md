### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a temporary landing page readme for one important message:

> I am in a legal situation currently where I may or may not be able to contribute to OSS, as
> [my current position owns all IP I generate while I am here](https://twitter.com/CAD97_/status/1296118208034996224?s=20).
> Informal conversation suggested that this does not cover IP generated completely without the University's resources
> (as hard as that may be to accomplish, and harder to prove), but I strongly disagree that that is what the agreement
> actually states and we are legally bound to. I'm planning/hoping to talk to someone to get at least some certainty
> that I'm able to contribute to OSS without putting myself (and more importantly, the project) at legal risk.
>
> In the mean time until I can have said discussion, I'm, in an abundance of caution, halting any OSS contributions
> that can be construed as IP (e.g. code or documentation). I believe discussion of how things _currently_ work is
> clearly not generating any new IP, so is still fine. I can still help you use my libraries or understand how they
> currently work, just not contribute any new ideas towards their (or other OSS projects') development until this
> legal question is resolved.
>
> And if the question is resolved as "well, sure, you're _probably_ fine," I'm probably going to continue doing OSS work
> (whatever time I have for it), as I enjoy doing it, and I _can_ divorce it entirely from the University resources.

I'll probably do something better with this readme once the above concern is addressed.
