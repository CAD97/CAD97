### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a second[^1]-year graduate student at [SMU Guildhall](https://www.smu.edu/guildhall) pursuing a **Professional Certificate in Digital Game Development** with a specialization in Programming. If all goes to plan, I plan to pursue a master's thesis on integrating Rust into an existing C++ game codebase.

[^1]: Sad disclaimer: medical issues made the second year last two years. I'm better now, though!

When I'm not doing gamedev related things, I also enjoy working on Rust open-source tooling. Some notable repositories I've landed code in include:

- [rust-lang/rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commits?author=cad97)
- [rust-lang/rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/commits?author=cad97)
- [rust-analyzer/rowan](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rowan/commits?author=cad97)
- [dtolnay/syn](https://github.com/dtolnay/syn/commits?author=cad97)
- [tokio-rs/tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/commits?author=cad97)
- [maciejhirsz/logos](https://github.com/maciejhirsz/logos/commits?author=cad97)
- [pest-parser/pest](https://github.com/pest-parser/pest/commits?author=cad97)
- [cad97/pointer-utils](https://github.com/cad97/pointer-utils/commits?author=cad97)

and probably more.
