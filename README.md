### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer with a specialization in systems and tooling development for digital game development. I have a master's level **Professional Certificate in Digital Game Development** from [SMU Guildhall](https://www.smu.edu/guildhall) and am a credited developer on three published games from my term there. I've invested significantly in making traditionally rather brittle developer workflows more resilient and empathetic to the developer, whether those systems be C++, Rust, integrating the two, or even fully ad-hoc environments.

When I'm not doing gamedev related things, I also enjoy working on Rust open-source tooling. Some notable repositories I've landed code in include:

- [rust-lang/rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commits?author=cad97)
- [rust-lang/rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/commits?author=cad97)
- [rust-analyzer/rowan](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rowan/commits?author=cad97)
- [dtolnay/syn](https://github.com/dtolnay/syn/commits?author=cad97)
- [tokio-rs/tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/commits?author=cad97)
- [maciejhirsz/logos](https://github.com/maciejhirsz/logos/commits?author=cad97)
- [pest-parser/pest](https://github.com/pest-parser/pest/commits?author=cad97)
- [cad97/pointer-utils](https://github.com/cad97/pointer-utils/commits?author=cad97)

and probably more. [My portfolio](https://resume.cad97.com/) highlights the projects I've meaningfully contributed to.
